        		<h1>SAIL: Machine Learning Guided Structural Analysis Attack on Hardware Obfuscation</h1>
				<p>Obfuscation is a technique for protectinghardware intellectual property (IP) blocks againstreverse engineering, piracy, and malicious modifica-tions. Current obfuscation efforts mainly focus onfunctional locking of a design to prevent black-boxusage. They do not directly address hiding designintent through structural transformations, which isan important objective of obfuscation. We note thatcurrent obfuscation techniques incorporate only: (1)local, and (2) predictable changes in circuit topology.In this paper, we present SAIL, a structural attackon obfuscation using machine learning (ML) modelsthat exposes a critical vulnerability of these meth-ods. Through this attack, we demonstrate that thegate-level structure of an obfuscated design can beretrieved in most parts through a systematic set ofsteps. The proposed attack is applicable to all formsof logic obfuscation, and significantly more powerfulthan existing attacks, e.g., SAT-based attacks, sinceit does not require the availability of golden func-tional responses (e.g. an unlocked IC). Evaluationon benchmark circuits show that we can recover anaverage of around 84% (up to 95%) transformationsintroduced by obfuscation. We also show that thisattack is scalable,flexible, and versatile. </a></p>
